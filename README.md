# DistributedDatabase

This was a part of my Bachelor degree project. The thesis which accompanies this can be found [here](http://goo.gl/hQKdjs).

This is an implementation in Java of a distributed key-value database for storing large collections of images.

I did it using the Consistent Hashing algorithm in the same way it was implemented by Amazon in the Dynamo database ([white paper](http://s3.amazonaws.com/AllThingsDistributed/sosp/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf))
